# Voice Prescription

![Header](image.png)

## Project Overview

This side project involved the development of a voice prescription tool. The project utilized feature extraction from speech, employing fuzzy logic, Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC), and Dynamic Time Warping (DTW). The ultimate goal was to generate a medical prescription based on the extracted features from the user's voice.

## Project Significance

In the realm of healthcare, leveraging voice technology for prescription generation introduces a novel and potentially efficient approach. This project aimed to explore the integration of feature extraction techniques from speech to automate the prescription process, offering a user-friendly and accessible tool for medical professionals.

## Technologies Used

The project made use of fuzzy logic, MFCC, and DTW for feature extraction from speech. These technologies were selected for their effectiveness in capturing nuanced aspects of spoken language and facilitating accurate analysis for prescription generation.

## Project Workflow

1. **Voice Input:** Users provided spoken information relevant to the medical condition or symptoms.
2. **Feature Extraction:** Fuzzy logic, MFCC, and DTW were employed to extract meaningful features from the voice input.
3. **Prescription Generation:** Based on the extracted features, the system generated a medical prescription tailored to the user's provided information.

## How to Use

The training audio files are in `sample_data` labeled as `example.mp3`.
The test audio files are in `sample_data` labeled as `test.mp3`.
Download and run the `Voice Prescription.ipynb` file.

## Conclusion

The Voice Prescription project explores the intersection of voice technology and healthcare, offering a unique tool for generating medical prescriptions through feature extraction from speech. By simplifying the prescription process, this project contributes to the ongoing efforts to enhance accessibility and efficiency in healthcare services.
